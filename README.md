# timelapse
code to generate daily WFH vlogs in a timelapse

This is a video-journalling/vlog attempt to capture how I spend time everyday in my room during the pandemic/WFH.
It captures images from your webcam at every 5 seconds(editable) and stitches all the images captured in a video at 12 frames-per-second (editable)
Just run the code.py file to start captureing, and hit ESC in the timelapse window, to stop capturing and complete the video stitiching.

REQUIREMENTS - 
* Python3
* OpenCV
* Moviepy.video.io

FUTURE WORK -
* Add a text slide or voice over on the video after capturing is done. (To mimic true journalling and analyes for later perusal)
* Upload to YouTube/Google Drive at the push of a button
* Convert this to an app/web-app that can remotely trigger start/stop recorodings. 

Any other ideas for this project will be appreciated, please feel free to email me at viralpasad[at]vt[dot]edu or shoot me a text at linkedIn.com/in/viralnotprasad.
Happy journalling, stay healthy, stay home.
